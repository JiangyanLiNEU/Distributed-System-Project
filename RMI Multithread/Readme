Hi,

This is the instruction for my project 2. Thank you for taking time to check my project! :-)

1) Open two terminal: one for server and ont for client

2) Server terminal:
   cd out/artifacts/S_jar   => get into S_jar folder
   java -jar p2.jar         => should see "Server is running on port 1111..."

3) Client terminal: (you can do this as many times as you want)
   cd out/artifacts/C_jar   => make sure you are in C_jar folder and you can see p2.jar
   java -jar p2.jar         => should see "what is client's name? -- welcome to runClient1"
   enter a name for client  => you should see  ====== STORE ======

3) test all functions


NOTE: 1) You can do "java -jar p2.jar" as many times as you want -- this is multithread project.
      2) All clients shared the same store.
